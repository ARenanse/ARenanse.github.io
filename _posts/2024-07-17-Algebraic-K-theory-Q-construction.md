title: "Algebraic K-theory : The K-theory spectrum"
---
Continuing the posts on $$K$$-theory, I'll like to talk about the next step after $$BGL(R)^+$$, that is, the $$Q$$-construction. It is only using this and the famous $$+=Q$$-theorem that we'll be able to talk about $$K$$-theory of rings and schemes together. 

## Classifying space of a category
Recall the for a category $$\mathscr{C}$$ its nerve is defined as a simplicial set $$N\mathscr{C}$$ whose $$n$$-simplices are given by the $$ n$$-long string of arrows $$a_0\to a_1 \to \dots \to a_n$$. The face map $$ d_i : N\mathscr{C}_n \to N\mathscr{C}_{n-1}$$ omits the $$i^\text{th}$$-term.
