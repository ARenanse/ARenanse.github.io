 1. *[Memory capacity of recurrent neural networks with matrix representation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231223009475), with A. Sharma & R. Chandra. Neurocomputing, Volume 560, December 2023*. 
 
    We study Fisher information capacity of recurrent networks with matrix representations and compare it with the known results for usual vector representations. We also introduce a new differentiable neural structure with matrix representations throughout and compare it with the traditional neural turing machine on some algorithmic tasks.

 2. *[C-triviality of low dimensional manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05558v1), with S. Sharma. Preprint.*

    We classify those low dimensional manifolds upto homology which satisfy the property of $C$-triviality; every complex vector bundle over such a space has trivial Chern classes. Our main tool is the order of differentials of Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence.
