Below are some of the major projects I'd done in the past. All of them are related with machine learning.

[3] [Neural Turing Machine](https://github.com/WhenDustSettles/Neural-Turing-Machine) : A TensorFlow implementation of perhaps the first differentiable memory architecture introduced in arXiv:1410.5401. 

[2] [Langevin Gradient Parallel Tempering](https://github.com/WhenDustSettles/LGPT/tree/master) : A package I once made on PyTorch containing a multiple mode sampling algorithm proposed by the same name in arXiv:1811.04343v1. 

[1] [MLPack](https://github.com/WhenDustSettles/MLPack) : Implementations of basic machine learning algorithms from scratch. Current algorithms include:
1. 1D K Means Clustering (.py)
2. Decision Trees (.py)
3. Kernel Density Estimate (.py)
4. Linear Regression via gradient descent(.cpp).
