Some notes on specefic topics/questions.

* **[Perverse sheaves & intersection homology](/assets//notes/Others/SingSpaces.pdf)** : Notes made for the seminar by the same name that ran during Jan-May '24 at ISIB by Charanya Ravi. More details [here](https://charanyaravi.github.io/Sem2-23-24/Sem2-23-24:IH:index.html).
* **[Strongly local constructions](/assets/notes/Others/SLConstr.pdf)** : A common generalization of normalization of an integral scheme and reducing a scheme to its reduced scheme. Both constructions can be done on rings to yield a new ring and they behave well with localization to assist in gluing. We generalize this procedure by only using the essential fact that the said construction commutes with localization.
* **[The uniqueness of $$+$$-construction](/assets/notes/Others/PlusConst.pdf)** : Classically, higher $$K$$-groups were defined by taking the homotopy groups of $$BGLR^+$$ for a ring $$R$$. A crucial step is to show that the homotopy type $$BGLR^+$$ is unique. While the existence is well-known and can be found easily in standard references, the uniqueness requires basic facts from obstruction theory and follows from its construction. In this note, we show the existence and uniqueness of $$+$$-construction.
* **[A generalization of Swan's theorem](/assets/notes/Others/SwanTych.pdf)** : We generalize Swan's theorem from compact-Hausdorff spaces to Tychonoff spaces (completely regular or $$T_{3\frac{1}{2}}$$). Consequently, we show that on Tychonoff spaces soft bundles and stably trivial bundles are equivalent.





## Expository
<!-- Here is my FoG and other notes. Here is [my FoG](/assets/notes/TheFoG.pdf). -->
Here are some more expository notes which cover larger areas. Please let me know if you find some mistake!

I have combined all the files below in [one file here](/assets/notes/TheFoG.pdf) for proper indexing across documents. This also indexes additional topics which I wish to get around sometime.

* **[Algebraic Geometry](/assets/notes/individualized/Algebraic%20Geometry/FAG.pdf)** : 
These are some ongoing notes on algebraic geometry which I've been making while reading & solving Hartshorne, Mumford-Oda and other online resources.

* **[Commutative Algebra](/assets/notes/individualized/Commutative%20Algebra/CA.pdf)** :
These are some ongoing notes on commutative algebra made from courses and Atiyah-MacDonald, Eisenbud, etc.

* **[Foundational Geometry](/assets/notes/individualized/Foundational%20Geometry/FG.pdf)** : 
These notes contain some formal stuff about locally ringed spaces, sheaves and atlases, algebra of $$\mathscr{O}_X$$-modules, category of $$\mathscr{O}_X$$-modules, etc. These come in handy while discussing schemes and modules over them. Most of these are informed from Wedhorn.

* **[Homotopy Theory](/assets/notes/individualized/Homotopy%20theory/FHT.pdf)** : 
These are about 50% done.

* **[Algebraic $$K$$-theory of rings](/assets/notes/individualized/AKT/KTheory.pdf)** : Some notes on lower $$K$$-theory and $$BGL(R)^+$$ made during the summer '24 visit to IMSc Chennai under Dr. Rahul Gupta. Something of interest here might be a proof of universal property of $$+$$-constructions using obstruction theory, which helps in proving the uniqueness of the homotopy type of $$BGL(R)^+$$.

* **[Grothendieck Topologies & Topos Theory](/assets/notes/individualized/Topos/Sheaves%20&%20Toposes.pdf)** : 
These notes were made while studying this topic under Dr. Amit Kuber during the summer of '21.

* **[Sheaf Theory](/assets/notes/individualized/Sheaf/sheaf.pdf)** : Notes on sheaves and their cohomology. These are fairly complete (except the CÄ›ch-to-derived functor spectral sequence) and are used regularly in other parts.

* **[Simplicial Sets](/assets/notes/individualized/Higher%20Cats/L8C.pdf)** : Some very rudimentary and incomplete notes on simplicial sets.

* **[Homological Methods](/assets/notes/individualized/HM/HM.pdf)** : Notes on abelian categories and derived functors. I will soon add a section on derived categories as learned from perverse sheaves seminar.

* **[Analysis on $$\mathbb{C}$$](/assets/notes/individualized/CA/CA.pdf)** : Some typical notes for a standard complex analysis course.

* **[Riemann Surfaces](/assets/notes/individualized/CA/RS.pdf)** : Some notes I made for Riemann surfaces seminar at ISIB which ran around the end of complex analysis course. Goal is to reach Riemann-Roch theorem. These are far from complete.

* **[Abstract Analysis](/assets/notes/individualized/AA/AA.pdf)** : Notes on measure theory and functional analysis with solutions to many exercises. Made while taking the courses under the same name at ISIB. 

* **[Ordinary Differential Equations](/assets/notes/individualized/ODE/CODE.pdf)** : Notes for the course by the same name at IISERK. Contains an exposition of initial value problems and linearization of autonomous systems.
