Following are some notes I've made with some specific questions in mind, for some seminar, some interesting observation while reading, etc. All of them are later incoporated in some form in blog posts or expository notes below.

* *Perverse sheaves & intersection homology* : Notes made for the seminar by the same name that ran during Jan-May '24 at ISIB by Charanya Ravi. More details [here](https://charanyaravi.github.io/Sem2-23-24/Sem2-23-24:IH:index.html).
* *Strongly local constructions*
* *The uniqueness of $$+$$-construction*





## Expository
<!-- Here is my FoG and other notes. Here is [my FoG](/assets/notes/TheFoG.pdf). -->
I've been making notes for my reference since quite some time. I find this habit useful as it allows me to know the topic in question quite intimately. Some of the notes below might not be complete (I write out the index of planned topics first and then fill the details), but I have been pretty regular in updating them every week. All of the notes below enjoy many results and simplifications obtained from fruitful discussions with friends and teachers. Please let me know if you find any mistake!

[I am also maintaing a combined single pdf file consisting of all the notes below for proper cross-references here](/assets/notes/TheFoG.pdf).

* **[Algebraic Geometry](/assets/notes/individualized/Algebraic%20Geometry/FAG.pdf)** : 
These are some ongoing notes on algebraic geometry which I've been making while reading & solving Hartshorne, Mumford-Oda and other online resources.

* **[Commutative Algebra](/assets/notes/individualized/Commutative%20Algebra/CA.pdf)** :
These are some ongoing notes on commutative algebra made from courses and Atiyah-MacDonald, Eisenbud, etc.

* **[Foundational Geometry](/assets/notes/individualized/Foundational%20Geometry/FG.pdf)** : 
These notes contain some formal stuff about locally ringed spaces, sheaves and atlases, algebra of $$\mathscr{O}_X$$-modules, category of $$\mathscr{O}_X$$-modules, etc. These come in handy while discussing schemes and modules over them. Most of these are informed from Wedhorn.

* **[Homotopy Theory](/assets/notes/individualized/Homotopy%20theory/FHT.pdf)** : 
These notes started from an algebraic topology course which I audited at IISERK, in which we covered till Galois theorem for covers. I then started reading homotopy theory and added notes, primarily from May and Whitehead, and then also from the course Topology II at ISIB where we covered homology and CW-complexes. These are about 50% done.

* **[Algebraic $$K$$-theory of rings](/assets/notes/individualized/AKT/KTheory.pdf)** : Some notes on lower $$K$$-theory and $$BGL(R)^+$$ made during the summer '24 visit to IMSc Chennai under Dr. Rahul Gupta. Something of interest here might be a proof of universal property of $$+$$-constructions using obstruction theory, which helps in proving the uniqueness of the homotopy type of $$BGL(R)^+$$.

* **[Grothendieck Topologies & Topos Theory](/assets/notes/individualized/Topos/Sheaves%20&%20Toposes.pdf)** : 
These notes were made while studying this topic under Dr. Amit Kuber during the summer of '21.

* **[Sheaf Theory](/assets/notes/individualized/Sheaf/sheaf.pdf)** : Notes on sheaves and their cohomology. These are fairly complete (except the CÄ›ch-to-derived functor spectral sequence) and are used regularly in other parts.

* **[Simplicial Sets](/assets/notes/individualized/Higher%20Cats/L8C.pdf)** : Some very rudimentary and incomplete notes on simplicial sets. I am planning to complete the basics as this is needed in higher algebraic $$K$$-theory.

* **[Homological Methods](/assets/notes/individualized/HM/HM.pdf)** : Notes on abelian categories and derived functors. I will soon add a section on derived categories as learned from perverse sheaves seminar.

* **[Analysis on $$\mathbb{C}$$](/assets/notes/individualized/CA/CA.pdf)** : Some typical notes for a standard complex analysis course.

* **[Riemann Surfaces](/assets/notes/individualized/CA/RS.pdf)** : Some notes I made for Riemann surfaces seminar at ISIB which ran around the end of complex analysis course. Goal is to reach Riemann-Roch theorem. These are far from complete.

* **[Abstract Analysis](/assets/notes/individualized/AA/AA.pdf)** : Notes on measure theory and functional analysis with solutions to many exercises. Made while taking the courses under the same name at ISIB. 

* **[Ordinary Differential Equations](/assets/notes/individualized/ODE/CODE.pdf)** : Notes for the course by the same name at IISERK. Contains an exposition of initial value problems and linearization of autonomous systems.
